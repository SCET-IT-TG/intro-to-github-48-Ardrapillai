    <p>Links in HTML are a connection between two resources over the web. HTML links (also known as hyperlink) allow a user to navigate from a source to a destination.
Apart from that, HTML links can also be manipulated into storing a specific location on a webpage (e.g. On the top-left of this page you can find a section that has a list of topics covered in the article. The list items are links that have the location of the topic section and upon clicking on the link you can directly jump to that section), or we can make a link to download a file on the web.
